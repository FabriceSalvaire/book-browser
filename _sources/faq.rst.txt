How to get help or report an issue ?
------------------------------------

.. There is no mailing list or forum actually, so you can either contact me or fill an issue on Github.

If you want to **discuss or ask questions on BookBrowser**, you can subscribe and post messages on the
**BookBrowser User** mailing list.

.. There is actually three lists running on Google Groups (*):

.. `User List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/BookBrowser-user>`_
..  List for BookBrowser users
.. `Announce List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/BookBrowser-announce>`_
..  List for announcements regarding BookBrowser releases and development
.. `Devel List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/BookBrowser-devel>`_
..  List for developers of BookBrowser

**If you encounter an issue, please fill an issue** on the `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/FabriceSalvaire/BookBrowser/issues>`_.

.. (*) Despite Google Groups has many drawbacks, I don't have actually enough resources to run GNU Mailman or
   Discourse on my own IT infrastructure.
