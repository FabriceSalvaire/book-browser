* `unpaper <https://github.com/Flameeyes/unpaper>`_

     Unpaper is a post-processing tool for scanned sheets of paper, especially for book pages that have
     been scanned from previously created photocopies. The main purpose is to make scanned book pages
     better readable on screen after conversion to PDF. Additionally, unpaper might be useful to
     enhance the quality of scanned pages before performing optical character recognition (OCR).

* `scanbd <https://sourceforge.net/projects/scanbd>`_

    Scanbd is a scanner button daemon. It polls the scanner buttons looking for buttons pressed or
    function knob changes or other scanner events as paper inserts / removals and at the same time
    allows also scan-applications to access the scanners. If buttons are pressed, etc., various
    actions can be submitted (scan, copy, email, ...) via action scripts. The function knob values are
    passed to the action-scripts as well. Scan actions are also signaled via dbus. This can be useful
    for foreign applications. Scans can also be triggered via dbus from foreign applications. On
    platforms which support signaling of dynamic device insertion / removal (libudev, dbus, hal)
    scanbd supports this as well.
